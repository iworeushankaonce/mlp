# Implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Pure NumPy from scratch

This repository contains a variant of implementing a standard MLP with two layers for educational purposes. Relative simplicity of this particular implementation was aimed to show the constructions upon which some more advanced models are based, how forward and backward passes are computed and etc. In future versions an arbitrary number of layers and neurons per layer will be allowed.

## Installation



```bash
git clone https://github.com/iworeushankaonce/mlp.git
```

## Usage
### 1.1 Create an instance of MLP class
```python

```

### 1.2 Methods and properties of MLP class
```python

```

### 2.1 fit and predict methods
```python

```

## Future features
1. MLP class with arbitrary layers
2. Implement important activation functions 'Leaky ReLU', 'ELU', 'linear', 'softmax' and 'sigmoid'
3. Implement important loss functions 'binary_crossentropy', 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy','categorical_crossentropy','MSE','MAE',
